In the first image you have the home screen where you enter your wealth. There is a box for stock value, asset value and cash value. At the top of the screen there is a "View Saved Graphs" button. This will take you to a new screen that will present all your graphs that you have saved. 

Second image presents the graph for your wealth that you have previously entered. Not evident in the picture but as the screen is displayed the bars animate up. Towards the bottom of the screen you have two options: "Save" or "Recalculate". Choosing "Save" will save your graph into the saved graphs section on the home screen. "Recalculate" will take you back to the previous page so you can re-input your values. 

The third image shows the screen of your saved graphs. Each saved graph is named with a date and time stamp of when it was saved. Clicking on each of these will take you to a preview of the corresponding graph, giving some details about your wealth at this stage.

The fourth and final image is the screen that you are taken to when one of the saved graphs are selected. At the top the title will be the date and time stamp of when the graph was saved. Differently to the second image, this screen will give you the exact values of stocks, assets and cash, while also present it in a colour coordinated bar chart.
